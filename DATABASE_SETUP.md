# Firestore Database Configuration Complete

## ✅ What's Been Configured

Your Firestore database is now fully configured with:

### 1. **Security Rules** (`firestore.rules`)
- **Role-based access control** (ADMIN, TEACHER)
- **Data validation** for all collections
- **Secure access patterns** with helper functions
- **Proper authentication checks**

### 2. **Database Indexes** (`firestore.indexes.json`)
- Optimized queries for anecdotal records by student and date
- Composite indexes for flagged records
- Performance-optimized student and class queries

### 3. **Storage Rules** (`storage.rules`)
- Secure file upload permissions
- Size limits (10MB for attachments, 5MB for profiles)
- Content type restrictions
- Role-based storage access

### 4. **Configuration Files**
- `firebase.json` - Main Firebase configuration
- `deploy-firestore.bat` - Deployment script

## 🗃️ Database Structure

### Collections:

1. **`users`** - User profiles and roles
   ```typescript
   {
     id: string,
     name: string,
     email: string,
     role: 'ADMIN' | 'TEACHER'
   }
   ```

2. **`classes`** - Class information
   ```typescript
   {
     id: string,
     name: string,
     teacherId: string
   }
   ```

3. **`students`** - Student records
   ```typescript
   {
     id: string,
     fullName: string,
     classId: string
   }
   ```

4. **`anecdotal_records`** - Learning observations
   ```typescript
   {
     id: string,
     studentId: string,
     authorId: string,
     note: string,
     valueTag: string,
     assessmentType: 'FORMATIVE' | 'SUMMATIVE',
     isFlaggedForReport: boolean,
     createdAt: Timestamp,
     fileUrl?: string
   }
   ```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Deploy Database Rules
Run the deployment script:
```bash
# Windows
deploy-firestore.bat

# Or manually:
firebase login
firebase use infinity-education-26e2a
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,firestore:indexes,storage
```

### 2. Enable Authentication in Firebase Console
1. Go to Firebase Console → Authentication
2. Enable Email/Password sign-in
3. Optionally enable Google sign-in

### 3. Set Up Initial Admin User
After deploying rules, create your first admin user:
1. Register through your app
2. Manually update the user document in Firestore Console:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Your Name",
     "email": "your-email@example.com",
     "role": "ADMIN"
   }
   ```

## 🔒 Security Features

✅ **Authentication Required** - All operations require valid user authentication  
✅ **Role-Based Access** - Admins and teachers have different permissions  
✅ **Data Validation** - All writes are validated for correct data structure  
✅ **Teacher Isolation** - Teachers can only access their own classes and students  
✅ **Author Protection** - Users can only edit their own anecdotal records  
✅ **File Upload Security** - Size limits and content type restrictions
