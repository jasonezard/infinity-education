# Testing Instructions for Infinity Education

## Issues Fixed

1. **Authentication Flow**: ✅ Fixed
2. **UI Rendering**: ✅ Fixed  
3. **Missing Buttons**: ✅ Fixed
4. **TypeScript Errors**: ✅ Fixed (28 errors resolved)
5. **React Hook Warnings**: ✅ Fixed (8 warnings resolved)

## Current Status

The application now builds and runs successfully. The main issue was that after authentication, users weren't seeing the dashboard because they weren't assigned to any classes.

## How to Test

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
npm run dev
```
The application will run on `http://localhost:5173`

### 2. Authentication Testing

#### Option A: Use Google Sign-In (Recommended)
1. Click "Continue with Google" on the login page
2. Sign in with your Google account (e.g., jezard@gmail.com)
3. You'll see a "No class assigned" message with your user ID
4. Copy your user ID from the screen

#### Option B: Create Test User Account
If you want to test with a specific user, follow these steps:

1. After signing in with Google, note your Firebase User ID displayed on screen
2. Run the linking script to assign you to a class:
   ```bash
   cd scripts
   node link-user-to-class.js your-email@gmail.com YOUR_FIREBASE_UID
   ```
3. Refresh the page - you should now see the full dashboard

### 3. Expected Behavior After Authentication

**With Class Assignment:**
- Dashboard with class overview
- Student roster with navigation
- Evidence volume charts
- "Add Record" button and floating action button
- Navigation menu with Dashboard and Add Record options

**Without Class Assignment:**
- "No class assigned" message
- Your user ID displayed for linking
- Instructions for assigning to a class

### 4. Test Features

Once you're assigned to a class, you can test:

1. **Dashboard Navigation**: Click between Dashboard and Add Record
2. **Student Profiles**: Click on student names to view their profiles
3. **Add Records**: Use the floating action button or menu to add new records
4. **Charts**: View evidence volume by skill type

## Database Status

The database is populated with:
- 👨‍🏫 Teachers: 4
- 🏫 Classes: 6  
- 👨‍🎓 Students: 28
- 📝 Anecdotal Records: 87

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "No class assigned" message
**Solution**: Run the link-user-to-class.js script with your Firebase UID

### Issue: Can't see any data
**Solution**: Make sure you're signed in and assigned to a class

### Issue: Buttons not working
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors - all major issues have been fixed

## Technical Notes

- The application uses Firebase Auth for authentication
- User profiles are stored in Firestore
- Google Sign-In creates new users with TEACHER role by default
- Test data uses predefined IDs that need to be linked to real Firebase Auth UIDs
